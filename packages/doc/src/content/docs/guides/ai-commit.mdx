import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Feature Introduction ü§ñ

iGit's AI commit feature uses advanced AI models to analyze your code changes and automatically generate commit messages that comply with the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. This not only saves your time but also ensures the quality and consistency of commit messages.

## How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

<Steps>

1. **Collect Changes**

   When you run `igit commit`, iGit collects all changes in the Git staged area.

2. **Analyze Changes**

   The AI model analyzes these changes, including:
   - Modified file types
   - Code additions, deletions, and modifications
   - Change context

3. **Generate Commit Message**

   Based on the analysis, AI generates a commit message following the conventional commits specification, including:
   - Type (`feat`/`fix`/`docs` etc.)
   - Scope (optional)
   - Description
   - Detailed explanation (if needed)

4. **Confirm Commit**

   You can choose to accept or modify the generated commit message.

</Steps>

## Usage üìù

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate commit message and wait for confirmation
igit commit

# Generate commit message and commit directly
igit commit -y
```

### Commit Types

AI will automatically select the most appropriate commit type based on the changes:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Test-related changes
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

  AI will try to select the most accurate commit type, but you can modify it during the confirmation phase.

## Best Practices üí°

### 1. Keep Changes Focused

Include only related changes in each commit, so AI can better understand your intentions.

### 2. Use Staged Area

Make sure all files you want to commit are added to the staged area:

```bash
git add <files>
igit commit
```

### 3. Review Generated Messages

Although AI usually generates high-quality commit messages, it's best to quickly review them to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions.

## Common Questions ‚ùì

### Q: Why are generated commit messages sometimes not accurate enough?

A: This might be due to:
- Changes being too complex or scattered
- Staged area containing unrelated changes
- AI model unable to fully understand specific business context

### Q: How to improve the quality of generated commit messages?

1. Ensure each commit contains only related changes
