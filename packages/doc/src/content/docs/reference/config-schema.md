- [schema.json](https://igit.erguotou.me/schema/0.0.2/schema.json)

  Just add `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://igit.erguotou.me/schema/0.0.2/schema.json` comment in your `.config/igit.yaml` file, and you can use VSCode's yaml language server to check the syntax of the configuration file.
  
  We have automatically added this comment in the generated configuration file, so you don't need to add it manually.
